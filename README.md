[[License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple, yet powerful command-line utility to **automatically organize your files** into categorized subdirectories based on their file extensions. Clean up your messy Downloads, Documents, or any other directory with ease!

## ‚ú® Features

* **Automatic Categorization:** Organizes files into sensible categories like `Images`, `Documents`, `Videos`, `etc.`
* **Recursive Scan:** Processes files within subdirectories.
* **Dry Run Mode:** Preview changes before actually moving any files, ensuring peace of mind.
* **Verbose Output:** Get detailed information about what files are being processed and where they're going.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with Python, designed for efficiency.

## üöÄ Installation

You can install `file-organizer-cli` directly from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install file-organizer-cli
```

## üí° Usage

Once installed, you can use the `organize-files` command directly from your terminal.

### Basic Usage

To organize files in a directory, simply provide the path to that directory:

```bash
organize-files /path/to/your/messy_folder
```

For example, to organize your Downloads folder:

```bash
organize-files ~/Downloads
```

(On Windows, this might be `organize-files C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads`)

### Dry Run (Recommended First Step!)

Always use the `--dry-run` flag first to see exactly what changes will be made without actually moving any files. This is a great way to verify the tool's behavior before committing to changes.

```bash
organize-files /path/to/your/messy_folder --dry-run
```

### Verbose Output

Use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to get detailed information about each file being processed and its destination.

```bash
organize-files /path/to/your/messy_folder -v
```

### Combining Options

You can combine options. For instance, to see a verbose dry run:

```bash
organize-files /path/to/your/messy_folder --dry-run -v
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Categories

Files are moved into subdirectories based on their extensions. Here's a general idea of the default categories:

- **Images:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff, .webp
- **Documents:** .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx
- **Videos:** .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .flv, .wmv
- **Audio:** .mp3, .wav, .flac, .aac, .ogg
- **Archives:** .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz
- **Code:** .py, .cpp, .h, .java, .js, .html, .css
- **Others:** Any file with an unrecognized extension or no extension will go here.
