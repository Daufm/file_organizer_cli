## üöÄ Installation

### Clone from GitHub

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer-cli.git
cd file-organizer-cli
```

### Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

If there is a `requirements.txt` file, install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the CLI

You can run the CLI directly using Python:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder
```

Or, for a dry run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder --dry-run
```

Or with verbose output:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder -v
```

You can combine options as needed.

## üí° Usage

Once installed, you can use the `organize-files` command directly from your terminal if installed via PyPI, or use the Python module as shown above if cloned from GitHub.

### Basic Usage

To organize files in a directory, simply provide the path to that directory:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder
```

For example, to organize your Downloads folder:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli ~/Downloads
```

(On Windows, this might be `PYTHONPATH=src python -m file_organizer.cli C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads`)

### Dry Run (Recommended First Step!)

Always use the `--dry-run` flag first to see exactly what changes will be made without actually moving any files. This is a great way to verify the tool's behavior before committing to changes.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder --dry-run
```

### Verbose Output

Use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to get detailed information about each file being processed and its destination.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder -v
```

### Combining Options

You can combine options. For instance, to see a verbose dry run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m file_organizer.cli /path/to/your/messy_folder --dry-run -v
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Categories

Files are moved into subdirectories based on their extensions. Here's a general idea of the default categories:

- **Images:** .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif, .bmp, .tiff, .webp
- **Documents:** .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .rtf, .odt, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx
- **Videos:** .mp4, .mov, .avi, .mkv, .flv, .wmv
- **Audio:** .mp3, .wav, .flac, .aac, .ogg
- **Archives:** .zip, .rar, .7z, .tar, .gz
- **Code:** .py, .cpp, .h, .java, .js, .html, .css
- **Others:** Any file with an unrecognized extension or no extension will go here.
